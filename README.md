## Topics

- Using Twine to write interactive fiction stories
- Using CSS to add style to the Twine story
- Using Variables to keep track of story information

## Icebreaker
Start things off with a quick icebreaker activity so the students can get to know each other.

- [This or That](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/This-or-That-An-Icebreaker-that-Rocks-1977647) - the instructor poses questions to the students, and the students group up based on their answers. Each group will have an opportunity to argue briefly for their side. For a virtual camp, use Zoom's polling feature.

## Lecture
The lecture uses a [PowerPoint presentation](InteractiveStorytelling.pptx) to introduce students to interactive storytelling. It covers the background of interactive fiction, Twine, CSS, and variables.

### Virtual Lecture
The [virtual PowerPoint](InteractiveStorytellingVirtual.pptx) is a brief introduction to interactive fiction. It does not dive into the specifics of Twine.

## Kahoot Quiz
There is a quick [Kahoot quiz](https://create.kahoot.it/share/56702427-c0f6-4004-bbd1-f07d8c03138d) to gauge how well the students were paying attention during the lecture. There is a link to the quiz from the PowerPoint.

### Virtual Kahoot
There is a modified [Kahoot quiz](https://create.kahoot.it/share/interactive-storytelling-virtual/87fec6d2-3de2-43ac-960a-51f63524c79d) covering the content from the virtual lecture. There is a link to the quiz from the virtual PowerPoint.

## Follow-Along Activity
For the [follow-along activity](https://hylandtechoutreach.github.io/coding-activities/TwineLesson/TwineLesson.html), get into Twine and start building a story with the students.

### Student-driven Stories
It will be beneficial to allow the students to drive the story-writing process. Take suggestions from them for the content of the story, the branches, the characters, etc. Make sure their suggestions are conduvice to a story with at least one variable, and multiple branches reaching the same node.

An easy way to accomplish this is to make a "Day in the Life" story. Begin with the main character waking up. Have every branch eventually lead to the character going to bed at night. Throughout the day, choose to track some information that may change (e.g., the main character's **GPA**). This should allow room for creativity while covering all of the essential topics.

### Sections Marked OPTIONAL: In-Person
Most of the optional sections should be skipped, other than the "Custom Colors" section. The "CSS in Browser" section and "More on Variables" section are covered by the Lecture, and the "Next Steps" section is replaced by the Individual Exercise.

### Sections Marked OPTIONAL: Virtual
Skip the optional sections when facilitating the camp virtually. The information may not be covered by the virtual lecture, but it will be beneficial to limit the overall scope of the follow-along activity.

It may also be necessary to skip the "Tracking Story Information with Variables" section if time does not allow it. Ensure that students complete the follow-along activity with enough time to work on their own stories.

## Individual Exercise
Allow the students to complete the individual exercise. There is an open-ended option and a more structured option. The goal is for the students to enjoy themselves working in Twine or writing a story. Encourage them to be creative and have fun with their stories. If a student says they are "done" writing, try to guide them to another chapter or another pathway their story could take.
