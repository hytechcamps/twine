# VIRTUAL: Interactive Storytelling with Twine
A workshop introducing [Twine](http://twinery.org/2/#!/welcome) in ~2hrs. Twine is an open-source tool for telling interactive, nonlinear stories.

## Student Content
Student-facing content is available at [hytechcamps.github.io](https://hytechcamps.github.io/twine).

## Videos
- [Interactive Storytelling Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nylg0e3rRiQ&list=PL1P_sExxi-9NeogaTKc9lSzoUkqPuqHOT)
    - NOTE: The lecture video contains an example game. Students should have a chance to play the game themselves.
- [Interactive Storytelling Follow-Along](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PuIZa3iX7E&list=PL1P_sExxi-9NeogaTKc9lSzoUkqPuqHOT)

## Topics

- Using Twine to write interactive fiction stories
- Using CSS to add style to the Twine story
- Using Variables to keep track of story information

## Icebreaker
Start things off with a quick icebreaker activity so the students can get to know each other: [This or That](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/This-or-That-An-Icebreaker-that-Rocks-1977647)

1. Use Zoom polls to ask a few "this or that" questions
    - e.g., tea v. coffee, winter v. summer, breakfast v. dinner
    - This can also be done by showing a slide with the questions
1. Once each student has stated their opinion, go around the Zoom room and have each student introduce themselves and explain their preferences

## Virtual Lecture
The [virtual PowerPoint](InteractiveStorytellingVirtual.pptx) is a brief introduction to interactive fiction. It does not dive into the specifics of Twine.

## Virtual Kahoot
There is a modified [Kahoot quiz](https://create.kahoot.it/share/interactive-storytelling-virtual/87fec6d2-3de2-43ac-960a-51f63524c79d) covering the content from the virtual lecture. There is a link to the quiz from the virtual PowerPoint.

## Follow-Along Activity
For the [follow-along activity](https://hylandtechoutreach.github.io/coding-activities/TwineLesson/TwineLesson.html), get into Twine and start building a story with the students.

### Student-driven Stories
It will be beneficial to allow the students to drive the story-writing process. Take suggestions from them for the content of the story, the branches, the characters, etc. Make sure their suggestions are conducive to a story with at least one variable, and multiple branches reaching the same node.

An easy way to accomplish this is to make a "Day in the Life" story. Begin with the main character waking up. Have every branch eventually lead to the character going to bed at night. Throughout the day, choose to track some information that may change (e.g., the main character's **GPA**). This should allow room for creativity while covering all of the essential topics.

### Sections Marked OPTIONAL: Virtual
Skip the optional sections when facilitating the camp virtually. The information may not be covered by the virtual lecture, but it will be beneficial to limit the overall scope of the follow-along activity.

It may also be necessary to skip the "Tracking Story Information with Variables" section if time does not allow it. Ensure that students complete the follow-along activity with enough time to work on their own stories.

## Individual Exercise
If there is any time remaining, allow the students to complete the [individual exercise](IndividualExercise.md). There is an open-ended option and a more structured option. The goal is for the students to enjoy themselves working in Twine or writing a story. Encourage them to be creative and have fun with their stories. If a student says they are "done" writing, try to guide them to another chapter or another pathway their story could take.

## Sharing Stories
Toward the end of the session, encourage students to share their stories. Unfortunately, Twine does not have a built-in way to share stories easily. There are some [instructions](SharingStories.md) that walk through the process of adding their code to a Replit project. This is a little complicated, so if there is interest, walk through the process with the students at the end of the camp (the last 15 minutes or so).

If there is nothing else to do and the students are not active, feel free to end the workshop early.
