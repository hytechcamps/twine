# Sharing Stories
One of the best parts of creating stories is sharing them with others! Unfortunately, sharing stories is a little complicated with Twine, but it is still possible. When you want to share, follow these steps:

## Downloading the Story
First, download the story from Twine.

1. In Twine, open the story menu on the bottom left
1. Select the "Publish to File" option
