# Interactive Storytelling: Individual Exercise
Complete one of the exercises below. Choose between an open-ended activity and a more structured set of challenges.

## Open-ended: Create a New Story
Start from scratch and create a completely new story using Twine!

### Starting Point
Start by writing the story out on paper or in a text editor. This will make it easier to create the story in Twine. Once the story structure is ready to go, try to make it in Twine!

### Requirements
The new story should:

- Have at least three (3) choices for the player
- Have at least two (2) CSS styles (font, color, etc)
- Have at least one (1) variable tracked throughout the story

## Structured: Challenges
Complete the challenges starting from the existing story!

### Challenge 1 - A New Day
Continue the story by starting a new day for the main character. Make sure to provide a choice for the player in the first passage of the day.

### Challenge 2 - A New Image
Find another image and put it in a passage of the story. Try adding images to every single passage!

### Challenge 3 - A New Variable
Keep track of another piece of information throughout the story. For example, track the amount of money the main character has, the happiness of the main character, or any other statistics about them!

### Challenge 4 - More Styles
Use CSS to update the styles of the story. Follow [this tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) to learn more about what is possible with CSS.

### Challenge 5 - Conditional

#### Background
In computer science, a **conditional** is something that changes the flow of the program. For example, in a video game, the main character might be able to do some magic _if_ their magic level is high enough. This makes programs much more dynamic.

In Twine, it is possible to use **if statements** to show or hide some options from the player. For example, the player may only be able to buy a candy bar _if_ they have enough money.

#### Story
Add a conditional to the story. Check the [SugarCube documentation](https://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/2/docs/#macros-macro-if) to learn how to add a conditional in Twine!
